58 v THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATJN.

quantity by which alone the greatest of Latin orators regu-
lated his own rhythms‚⁷'

“All pronunciation is acquired by imitation, and it is not “

till after hearing a sound many times that we are able to
grasp it sufficiently well to imitate. It is a mistake con-
stantly made by teachers of language to suppose that a
pupil knows by once hearing unfamiliar sounds, or even
unfarniliar combinations of familiar sounds. When pupils
are made to imitate too soon, they acquire an erroneous
pronunciation, which they afterward hear constantly from
themselves actually or mentally‚ and believe that they hear
from the teacher during the small fraction of a second that
each sound lasts, and hence the habits of these organs be-
come fixed.'’

The following direction is of the utmost importance
(Curwen's “ Standard Course‚'' p. 3) : “The teacher never
sings (speaks) wilh his pupils, but sings (utters‚ reads, dic-
tates) to them a brief and soft pattern. The first art of the
pupil is to lz'sten well to the pattern‚ and then to imitate it
exactly. He that listens best sings (speaks) best.'' ’
