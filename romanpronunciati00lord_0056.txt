48 THE ROMAN PRONUNCJATJON OF LATJN.

Much time is wasted by students and bad habits are acquired
in not finding, at the outset, the right spelling of each word
and holding to it. This each student must do for himself,
consulting a good dictionary‚ as editors and editions are not
always to be depended on. Here it is the diphthongs that
present the chief difficulty and call for the greatest care.

In pronouncing diphthongs sound both vowels, but glide
so rapidly from the first to the second as to offer to the ear
buta single sound. In the publication of the Cambridge
(Eng.) Philological Society on “Pronunciation of Latin in
the Augustan Period‚'' the following directions are given:

“The pronunciation of these diphthongs‚ of which the
last three are extremely rare, is best learnt by first sounding
each vowel separately and then running thern together, ae
as ah-eh‚ au as ah-oo‚ oe as o-eh, ei as eh-ee‚ eu as eh-oo‚

and ui as oo-ee.''
Thus :

ae (ah-eh) as in German na'lzem· or as ea in pear3 or ay in

, aye (ever); (not like ἑ in fate nor like ai in aisle).

ai (ah-ee) 35 in aye (yes).

au (ah—oo) as in German Hans, with more of the u sound than
ou in house.

ei (eh-ee) nearly 35 in veil. (In dein, deinde, the ei is not a
diphthong‚ but the e, when not forming a distinct syllable,
is elided.)

eu (eh-oo) as in Italian Europa. (In neuter and neutiquam
elide the e.)

oe (o-eh) nearly like German ὃ in Geetlze.

oi is not found in the Classical period. (In proin, proinde, the
ο is either elided or forms a distinct syllable. ou in prout
is not a diphthong 3 the u is either elided or forms a dis-
tinct syllable.)

ui (oo-ee) as in cuirass.
