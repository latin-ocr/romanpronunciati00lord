HOW TO USE [Τ. 57

attempt has been made at a philosophical or exhaustive
treatment of the subject; but at the same time it is hoped
that nothing unphilosophical has crept in, or anything been
omitted, which might have been given, to render the subject
intelligible and enable the intelligent reader to understand
the points and be able to give a reason for each usage herein
recommended.

The main object in view in preparing this little book has

to furnish them something not too voluminous, yet as satis-

the present diversity of opinion and practice has rendered

To these teachers, then, a word from Professor Ellis may
