WHY WE USE IT. 43

the same form as occurring in nouns and verbs, as rages and
regbs‚· ancl in final syllables contracted or curtailed‚ as finit
(for finivit).

But since on this point the grammarians do not agree
among themselves, either as to number or class of excep-
tions, or even as to the manner of making them, we may
treat this matter as of no great importance (as in English,
we please ourselves in saying pe‘rsect or perstet). And here
it may be said that due attention to the quantity will of.
itself often regulate the accent in doubtful cases; as when
we say doce, if we duly shorten the ο and lengthen the e the
effect will be correct, whether the ear of the grammarian
detect accent on the final syllable, or not. For as Quin-
tilian well says :

Nam ut color oculorum indicio, sapor palati, odor narium
dinoscitur, ita sonus aurium arbitrio subjectus est.

P1TCH.

But besides the length of the syllable, and the place and
quality of the accent, another matter claims attention.

In English all that is required is to know the place of the
accent, which is simply distinguished by greater stress of
voice. This peculiarity of our language makes it more diffi-
cult for us than for other peoples to get the Latin accent,
which is one of pitch.

In Latin the acute accent means that on the syllable thus
accented you raise the pitch3 the grave indicates merely
the lower tone; the circumfiex, that the voice is first raised,
then depressed, on the same syllable. To quote again the
passage from Priscian :

[Keil. v. 111.p. 519] Acutus namque accentus ideo inventus est

quod acuat sive elevet syllabam, gravis vero eo quod deprimat
aut deponet3 circumflexus ideo quod deprimat et acuat.
