WHY WE USE IT. 27

And again ε

[Id. ib. p. 32.] K et q supervacue numero litterarum inseri doc-
torum plerique contendunt, scilicet quod c littera harum officium
possit implere.

The grammarians tell us that k and q are always found
at the beginning of a syllable :

[Prisc. Keil. v.111. p. 111.] Q et k semper initio syllabarum po-
nuntur.

They say also that the use of q was more free among the
earlier Romans, who placed it as initial wherever u fol-
lowed, —as they placed k wherever ἑ. followed, —but that
in the later, established, usage, its presence was conditioned
upon a vowel after the u in the same syllable:

[Donat. Keil. v. IV. p. 442] Namque illi q praeponebant quotiens
u sequebatur, ut quum,- nos vero non possumus q praeponere
nisi ut u sequatur et post ipsam alia vocalis, ut quoniam.

Diomedes says :

[Keil. v. 1. p. 425] Q consonans muta, ex c etu litteris composita,
supervacua, qua utimur quando u et altera vocalis in una syllaba
junguntur, ut Quirinus.

R is trilled, as in Italian or French:

[Mar. Vict. Keil. v. VI. p. 32.] Sequetur r, quae, vibratione vocis
in palato linguae fastigio, fragorem tremulis ictibus reddit.

(This proper trilling of the r is most important.)

S seems to have had, almost, if not quite, invariably the
sharp sound of the English S in sing, hiss.

In Greek words written also with z, as Smyrna (also
written Zmyrna), it probably had the z sound, and possibly
in a few Latin wordS, as rosa, miser, but this is not certain.
