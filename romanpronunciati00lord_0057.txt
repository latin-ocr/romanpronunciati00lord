HOW TO USE [Τ. 49

In the pronunciation of consonants certain points claim
special attention. And first among these is the sounding of
the doubled consonants. Whoever has heard Italian spoken
recognizes one of its greatest beauties to be the distinctness‚
yet smoothness‚ with which its 11 and rr and cc—- in short, all
its doubled consonants——are pronounced. No feature of
the language is more charming. And one who attempts the
same in Latin and perseveres, with whatever difficulty and
pains, will be amply rewarded in the music of the language.

A good working rule for pronouncing doubled consonants
is to hold the first until ready to pronounce the second ε as
in the words we'll lie till late, not to be pronounced as we lie
till ezglzt.

Next in importance‚ and, in New England at least, first in
difficulty, is the trilling of the r. There can be no approxi-
mation to a satisfactory pronunciation of Latin until this r
is acquired; but the satisfaction in the result when accom-
plished is well worth all the pains taken.

Another point to be observed is that the dentals t, d, n, 1,
require that the tongue touch the teeth‚ rather than the
palate. Munro says: “d and t we treat with our usual
slovenliness‚ and force them up to the roof of our mouth :
we should make them real dentals, as no doubt the Romans
made them, and then we shall see how readily ad at, apud
aput, illud illut and the like interchange.'' This requires
care, but amply repays the effort.

It is necessary also to remember that n before a guttura]
is pronounced as in the same position in English, e.g.‚ in
ancora as in anchor3 in anxius as in anxious3 in relinquo as
in relinquish.

Remember to make n before f or S a mere nasal, having
as little prominence otherwise as possible, and to carefully
lengthen the preceding vowel.
