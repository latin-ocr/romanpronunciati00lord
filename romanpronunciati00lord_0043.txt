WHY WE USE [Τ. 35

will certainly apply far better to vos than to was. In τινος
we get the “projectis labiis '³ to some extent, although not
so marked as in πω,- but we do not get anything like the
same “profuso intentoque flatu vocis '' as in 2205.

The same may be said of the argument drawn from the
anecdote related by Cicero in his de Divinatione .-

[Cic. de Div. XL. 84.] Cum M. Crassus exercitum Brundisii im-
poneret, quidam in portu caricas Cauno advectas vendens ‘⁶ Cau-
neas !'⁷ clamitabat. Dicamus, si placet, monitum ab eo Crassum
caveret ne iret, non fuisse periturum si omini paruisset.

Now when we remember that Caunos, whence these par—
ticular figs came, was a Greek town 3 that the fig-seller was
very likely a Greek himself (Brundisium being a Greek port
so to speak), but at any rate probably pronounced the name
as it was doubtless always heard ; and that u in such a con—
nection is at present pronounced like our f or v, and we
know of no time when it was pronounced like our u, it is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that the fig-seller was cry—
ing ‘⁴ Cafneas 1 '⁹ — a sound far more suggestive of Cave-ne-
eas J than “ Cauneas J’' of Cawe ne eas J

But beyond the testimony, direct and indirect‚ of gram-
marians and classic writers, an argument against the W
sound appears in the fact that this sound is not found in
Greek (from which the vau is borrowed), nor in Italian or
kindred Romance languageS.

The initial u in Italian represents not Latin u consonant,
but some other letter, as h, in nomo (for homo). On the
other hand we find the v sound, as vetlem (from vidua), —-
notice the two v sounds, -—- or the u sometimes changed to
b, as serbare from servare ,· bibita and bevanda, both from bibo.

In French we find the Latin u consonant passing into f,
as ovum into oeus‚· novem into neus.
