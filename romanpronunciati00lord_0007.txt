THE argument brought against the ‘Roman pronuncia-
tion' of Latin is twofold: 'the impossibility of perfect
theoretical knowledge, and the difficulty of practical attain-
ment.

If to know the main features of the classic pronunciation
of Latin were impossible, then our obvious course would be
to refuse the attempt3 to regard the language as in reality
dead, and to make no pretence of reading it. This is in
fact what the English scholars generally do. But if we may
know substantially the sounds of the tongue in which Cicero
spoke and Horace sung, shall we give up the delights of
the melody and the rhythm and content ourselves with the
thought form? Poetry especially does not exist apart from
sound; sense alone will not constitute it, nor even sense
and form without sound.

But if it is true that the task of practical acquisition is, if
not impossible, extremely difficult, ‘the work of a lifetime,'
as the objectors say, do the results justify the expenditure
of time and labor?

The position of the English-speaking peoples is not the
same in this as that of Europeans. Europeans have not
the same necessity to urge them to the ‘Roman pronuncia-
tion.' Their own languages represent the Latin more or
less adequately, in vowel sounds, in accent, and even, to
some extent, in quantity3 so that with them, all is not lost
