HOW Io ΗΒΕ [Τ. 47

And again :

“I do not propose that every one should learn Italian in
order to learn Latin. What I would suggest is, that those
who know Italian should make use of their knowledge and
should in many points take Italian sounds for the model to
be followed3 that those who do not know it should try to
learn from others the sounds required, or such an approxi—
mation to thern as may be possible in each case.’'

We may then surn up the results at which we have arrived
in the following directions ε

First of all pay particular attention to the vowel sounds,
to make them full and distinct, taking the Italian model, if

Pronounce

ἓ, as in Italianfczt0‚· or as final a in aha 1

Ξ as in Italian fatt0; or as initial a in aha l or as in fast (not
as in fat).

ἓ as second e in Italian fedele; or as in sete (not fate) ; or as
in vein.

ὅ as in Italian fetta; or as in very.

i as first i in Italian tz'mide,· or as in caprice.

i as second i in Italian tz’mz‘de; or as in capricious.

ior 1⁹1, where the spelling varies between the two (eg. maxi-
mus, maxumus), as in German Miiller.

ὃ as first o in Italian orl0‚· or as in more.

ὅ as first ο in Italian rottoj or as in wholly (not as in holly).

ἰι as in Italian rumore,- or as in rural.

ii as in Italian ruppe; or as in puss (not as in fuss).

Let i in vi before d, t, m, r or x, in the first syllable of
a word, be pronounced quite obscurely, somewhat as first i
in virgin.

In the matter of diphthongs‚ be sure to take always the
correct spelling, to begin with, and thus avoid what Munro
