46 THE ROMAN PRONUNCJATJON OF LATJN.

PART II.

How ΤΟ USE ΙΤ.

ΤΗΕ directions now to be given may be fittingly introduced
by a few paragraphs from Professor Munro's pamphlet on
the pronunciation of Latin, already more than once quoted
from. He says—and part of this has been cited before:

“We know exactly how Cicero or Quintilian did or could
spell; we know the syllable on which they placed the aceent
of almost every word 3 and in almost every case we already
follow them in this. Ι have the conviction that in their best
days philological people took vast pains to make the writing
exactly reproduce the sounding; and that if Quintilian or
Tacitus spelt a word differently from Cicero or Livy, he also
spoke it so far differently. With the same amount of evi-
dence, direct and indirect, we have for Latin, it would not, Ι
think, be worth anybody’s while to try to recover the pro-
nunciation of French or English3 it might, I think, be
worth his while to try to recover that of German or Italian,
in which sound and spelling accord more nearly, and accent
obeys more determinable laws.'' ⁷

‘⁴ I arn convinced,'' he says in another place, “that the
mainstay of an efficient reform is the adoption essentially of
the Italian vowel system: it combines beauty, firmness and
precision in a degree not equalled by any other system of
which I have any knowledge. The little ragged boys in
the streets of Rome and Florence enunciate their vowels in
a style of which princes might be proud.'' ”
