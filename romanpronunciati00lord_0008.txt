11 they translate the sounds into their own tongues, while
with us, nothing is left—sound, accent, quantity, all is gone 3
none 01 these is reproduced, or even suggested, in English.

We believe a great part 01 0111 difficulty, in this country,
lies in the fact that so few 01 those who study and teach
Latin really know what the ‘Roman pronunciation' is, or
how to use it. Inquiries are constantly being made by
teachers, Why is this so? What authority is there 101 this?
What reason 101 that ?

In the hope 01 giving help to those who desire to know
the Why and the How this little compendium 15 made3 in
the interest of time-and-labor-saving uniformity, and in the
belief that what cannot be fully known or perfectly acquired
does still not prevent our perceiving, and showing in some
worthy manner and to some satisfactory degree, how, as
well as what, the honey-tongued orators and divine poets
01 Rome spoke or sung.

In the following pages free use has been made 01 the
highest English authorities, 01 Oxford and Cambridge.
Quotations will be found from Ρ101. H. A. J. Munro's
pamphlet on “Pronunciation 01 Latin,’' and 110111 Ρ101.
A. J. Ellis’ book on “Quantitative Pronunciation 01 Latin'';
also 110111 the pamphlet issued by the Cambridge (Eng.)
Philological Society, on the ‘⁶ Pronunciation 01 Latin in the
Augustan Period.''

In the present compendium the chief points 01 divergence
110111 the general American understanding of the ‘Roman'
method are in respect 01 the diphthong ae and the con-
sonantal u. In these cases the pronunciation herein recom-
mended 101 the ae is that favored by Roby, Munro, and
Ellis, and adopted by the Cambridge Philological Society;
101 the V, or u consonant, that advocated by Corssen, A. J.
Ellis, and Robinson Ellis.
