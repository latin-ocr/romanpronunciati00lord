36 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATJN.

It seems not improbable that in Cicero’s time and later
the consonant u represented some variation of sound, that
its value varied in the direction of b or f, and possibly, in
some Greek words especially, it was more vocalized, as in
vae! (Greek ουάι). Yet here it is worthy of note that the
corresponding words in Italian are not written with u but
with gu, as ζειαί]

In considering the sound of Latin u consonant we must
always keep in mind that the question is one of time, —not,
was u ever pronounced as English W3 but, was it so pro-
nounced in the time of Cicero and Virgil. Professor Ellis
well says : “ Any one who wishes to arrive at a conclusion
respecting the Latin consonantal u must learn to pronounce
and distinguish readily the four series of sounds : tia sie fii
tio, wa we wi wo wu, v’a v’e v'i v’o νἰι, va ve vi vo
vu.''

Now the question is: At what point along this line do
we find the u consonant of the golden age? Roby, though
not agreeing with Ellis in rejecting the English W sound, as
the representative of that period, declares himself “quite
content to think that a labial v was provincially contem-
porary and in the end generally superseded it.''

But ‘provincialisms' do not seem sufficient to account
for the use of β for u consonant in inscriptions and in
writers of the first century. For instance, Nerva and
Severus in contemporary inscriptions are written both with
ου and With β : Νέρουα, Νέρβα; Σεουῆρος, Σεβῆρος. And in
Plutarch we find numerous instances of β taking the place
Of ov.

It is true that the instances in which we find β taking the
place of ov in the first century, and earlier, are decidedly in
the minority, but when we recollect that ov was the original
and natural representative of the Latin u, the fact that a
