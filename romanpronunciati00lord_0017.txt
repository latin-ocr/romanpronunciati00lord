WHY WE &SE [Τ. 9

brevis eademque longa, aptior ad hanc structuram visa est : quam
potestatem apud nos habet et i, quae est longa et brevis. Vos
igitur sine controversia ambiguitatis, et pluralem nominativum, et
singularem genitivum per ae scribite : nam qui non potest digno-
scere supra scriptarum vocum numeros et casum, valde est hebes.

Of oe Munro says ε

“When hateful barbarisms like coelum, coena, moestus, are
eliminated, oe occurs very rarely in Latin : coepi, poena,
moenia, coetus, proelia, besides archaisms caera, moerus, etc„
where oe, coming from oi, passed into u. If we must have
a simple sound, I should take the open e sound which Ι
have given to ae : but I should prefer one like the German
6. Their rarity, however, makes the sound of oe, eu, ui, of
less importance.''

Of au Munro says :

‘⁴ Here, too, au has a curious analogy with ae : The Latin
au becomes in Italian open ο : bro hde: Ι would pronounce
thus in Latin: plbstrum, Clbdius, chrm. Perhaps, too, the
fact that gloria, villaria and the common termination -0r2’0‚
have in Italian the open ο, might show that the correspond-
ing ὃ in Latin was open by coming between two liquids, or
before one: compare plenus above.’' “I should prefer,''
he says, (to represent the Latin au‚) “the Italian au, which
gives more os: the u than our οἶοί, cow.''

CONSONANTS.

B has, in general, the same sound as in English

[Mar. Vict. Keil. v. VI. p. 32.] E quibus b etp litterae . . . dispari
inter se oris officio exprimuntur. Nam prima exploso e mediis
labiis sono, sequens compresso ore velut introrsum attracto vocis

ictu explicatur.
