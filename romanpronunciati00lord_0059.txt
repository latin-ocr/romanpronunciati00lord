HOW TO USE [T. 51

n initial and final, as in nine.

n medial‚ as in damnable, always more dental than in English.

n before c, g, q, x, as in concord, anger, sinker, relinquish,
anxious, the tongue not touching the roof of the mouth.

n before f or s, nasal, lengthening the preceding vowel, as in
renaissance.

p as in pup.

q as in quick.

r as in roar, but trilled, as in Italian or French. (This is
most important.)

s as in sis (never as in his).

t as in tot, but more dental than in English (never as in
motion).

th nearly as in then (never as in thin).

v (u consonant) nearly as in verve, but labial, rather than
labio—dental 3 like the German W (not like the English W).
Make English v as nearly as may be done without touch-
the lower lip to the upper teeth.

x as in siX.

z nearly as dz in adze.

Doubled consonants to be pronounced each distinctly‚ by
holding the first until ready to pronounee the second.

As Professor Ellis well puts it: “No relaxation of the
organs, no puff of wind or grunt of voice should intervene
between the two parts of a doubled consonant, which should
more resemble separated parts of one articulation than two
separate articulations.''

“ Duplication of consonants is consequently regarded
simply as the energetic utterance of a single consonant.''

ELISION.

Professor Ellis believes that the m was always omitted
in speaking and the following consonant pronounced as if
doubled (quorum pars as quoruppars). Final m at the end
