HOW TO USE lT. 55

Let it be remembered in the matter of i consonant be-
tween two vowels, that we have really the force of two ii’s,
as originally written, one, vowel, making a diphthong with
the preceding, the other, consonant, introducing the new
syllable3 and that the same is true of the compounds of
jacio, which should be written with a single i but pronounced
as with two, as obicit (objicit).

ACCENT.

The question of accent presents little difficulty as to place,
but some as to quality, and much as to kind.

As to quality, it must be remembered that while the acute
accent is found on syllables either short or long (by nature
or position), and on either the penult or the antepenult‚
the circumflex is found only on long vowels, and (in words
of more than one syllable) only on the penult, and then only
in case the ultima is short. Thus, Spar, but dzix,· ίιῖηᾱ, but
ltine&- legatus, but legdti. In these examples the length of
the syllable is the same and of course remains the same in
inflection, but the quality of the accent changes. In the
one case the voice is both raised and depressed on the same
syllable, in the other it is only raised. As Professor Ellis
puts it: “If the last syllable but one is long, it is spoken
with a raised pitch, which is maintained throughout if its
vowel is short, as : vbnto's, or if the last syllable is long, as :
sdmcie,· but sinks immediately if its own vowel is long, and
at the same time the vowel of the last syllable is short, as
samii, to be distinguished from ῥέψει-κ’

But when we come to the question of the kind of accent,
we corne upon the most serious matter practically in the
pronunciation of Latin, and this because of a difficulty
peculiar to the English speaking peoples. The English
accent is one of stress, whereas the Roman is one ospitclz.
