WHY WE USE JT. 29

By which we understand that the ‘c was wrongly uttered
with a kind of effort, such as prevented its gliding on to
the i.

Th nearly as in tlzen, not as in tlzin.

U (consonant) or V.

That the letter u performed the office of both vowel and
consonant all the grammarians agree, and state the fact in
nearly the same terms. Priscian says that they (i and u)
seem quite other letters when used as consonants, and that
it makes a great difference in which of these ways they are
used :

[Keil. v. ΙΙ. p. 13.] Videntur tamen i et u cum in consonantes
transeunt quantum ad potestatem, quod maximum est in elementis,
aliae litterae esse praeter supra dictis; multum enim interest
utrum vocales sint an consonantes.

The grammarians also state that this consonant u was
represented by the Greek digamma, which the Romans
called vau also.

Marius Victorinus says :

[1.iii.44.] Nam littera u vocalis est, sicut a, e, i, o, sed eadem
vicem obtinet consonantis : cujus potestatis notam Graeci habent
f, nostri vau vocant, et alii dzgammaj ea per se scripta non facit
syllabam, anteposita autem vocali facit, ut ράμαξα, ρεκηβόλος et
feMvn. Nos vero, qui non habemus hujus vocis nomen aut
notam, in ejus locum quotiens una vocalis pluresve junctae unam
syllabam faciunt, substituimus u litteram.

Now it is contended by some that this dzgamma, or vau,
was merely taken as a symbol, somewhat arbitrarily perhaps,
and that it did not indicate a particular sound‚ but might
stand for anything which the Romans chose to represent by
it; and that therefore it gives us no certain indication of
what the Latin u consonant was.
