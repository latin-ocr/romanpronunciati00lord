QUANTrrY.

In the pronunciation of Latin the observance of quantity
and of pitch are the two most difficult points of attainment3
and they are the crucial test of good reading.

The observance of quantity is no less important in prose
than in verse. A little reflection will convince the dullest
mind that the Romans did not pronounce a word one way in
prose and another in verse, that we have not in poetry and
prose two languages. Cicero and Quintilian both enjoin a
due admixture of long and short syllables in prose as well
as verse3 and any one who takes delight in reading Latin
will heartily agree with Professor Munro when he says :
“For myself, by observing quantity, Ι seem to feel more
keenly the beauty of Cicero's style and Livy’s, as well as
Virgil's and Horace's.''

Therefore until one feels at home with the quantities‚ let
him observe the rule of beating time in reading, to make
sure that the long syllables get twice the time of the short
ones. In this way he will soon have the pronunciation of
each word correctly fixed in mind, and will not be obliged to
think of his quantities in verse more than in prose. A long
step has been taken in the enjoyment of Latin poetry when
the reader does not have to be thinking of the ⁴ feet.'

Young students particularly should be especially careful
in the final syllable of the verse. Since, so far as the meas—
ure is concerned, there is no difference there between the
long and the short syllable, the reader is apt to be careless
as to the length of the syllable itself, and to make all final
syllables long, even to the mispronouncing of the word,
thereby both making a false quantity and otherwise injur-
ing the effect of the verse, by importing into it a monotony
foreign to the original. Does not Cicero himself say that
