54 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATJON OF LATJN.

a short syllable at the end of the verse is as if you ⁴ stood²
(came to a stand), but a long one as if you ‘ sat down'?

It is, in fact, in the pronouncing of final syllables every-
where that the most serious and persistent faults are found,
ἑᾶς for bas being one of the worst and most common cases.

The disposition to neglect the double and doubled con-
sonants is another serious fault, as well as the slovenly pro-
nunciation of two consonants, where the reader fails to give
the time necessary to speak each distinctly, making false
quantity and mispronunciation at the same time.

In general, if two symbols are written we are to infer that
two sounds were intended. The only exception to this is
in the case of a few words where the spelling varies, as
casso or caso. In such cases we may suppose that the
doubled consonant was only· designed to indicate length.

Another, apparent, exception is in the case of a mute fol-
lowed by a liquid; but the mute and liquid are regularly
sounded as one, and therefore do not affect the length of
the preceding vowel. Sometimes, however, for the sake of
time, the verse requires thern to be pronounced separately.
In this case each is to be given distinctly3 the mute and
liquid must not coalesce. For it must not be forgotten that,
as a rule, the vowel before a mute followed by a liquid is short,
in which case it must on no account be lengthened. Thus,
ordinarily, we say pei—tris, but the verse may require pat-mk.

Although the vowel before two consonants is generally
short, we find, in some instances, a long vowel in this posi-
tion. For example, it would appear that the vowel of the
supine and cognate parts of the verb is long if the vowel of
the present indicative, though short, is followed by a medial
(b, g, d, z), as (ictus, lictus, from dgo, ίὲζξο.
