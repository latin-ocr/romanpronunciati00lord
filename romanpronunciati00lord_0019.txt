WHY WE USE [Τ. 11

And Priscian declares :

[Keil. v. 11. p. 13.] Quamvis in varia figura et vario nomine sint
k et q et c, tamen quia unam vim habent tarn in metro quam in
sono, pro una littera accipi debent.

Without the best of evidence we should hardly believe
that words written indifferently with ae or e after c would
be so differently pronounced by those using the diphthong
and those using the simple vowel, that, to take the instance
already given, in the time of Lucilius, the rustic said Sesz'lins
for Kaekilias. Nor does it seem probable that in different
cases the same word would vary so greatly, or that in the
numerous compounds where after c the a weakens to i the
sound of the c was also changed from k to S, as “Impia''
“ inszpz'o '',· ‘⁶ kado,’' “ insido.''

Quintilian, noting the changes of fashion in the sounding
of the h, enumerates, among other instances of excessive
use of the aspirate, the words clzoronae (for coronae), clzen-
turz‘ones (for centuriones), praechones (for praecones), as if the
three words were alike in their initial sound.

Alluding to inscriptions (first volume), where we have
pulcher and pulcer, Gracchis and Graccis, Mr. Munro says:
“ Ι do not well see how the aspirate could have been attached
to the c, if c had not a k sound, or how in this case c before
e or i could have differed from c before a, ο, u.⁷'

Professor Munro also cites an inscription (844 of the
“Corpus Inscr.,'' vol. I.) bearing on the case in another
way. In this inscription we have the word dekembres.
“This,'' says Mr. Munro, “is one of nearly two hundred
short, plebeian, often half-barbarous, very old inscriptions
on a collection of ollae. The k before e, or any letter ex-
cept a, is solecistic, just as in no. 831 is the c, instead of k,
for calendas. From this I would infer that, as in the latter
