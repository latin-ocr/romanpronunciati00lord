8 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATJN.

Munro says :

“ In Lucilius's time the rustics said Ceciliuspretor sor Cae-
cilius praet0r; in two Samothracian inscriptions older than
B.C. 100 (the sound of ai by that time verging to an open
e), we find muste piei and maste: in similar inscriptions
μύσται piei, and mystae: Paelzgnz‘ is reproduced in Strabo by
Πελιγνόιε Cicero, Virgil, Festus, and Servius all alike give
caestos sor κεστός; by the first century, perhaps sooner, e
was very frequently put for ae in words like taeter: we often
find teter, erumna, mestus, presto and the like: soon inscrip-
tions and MSS. began pertinaciously to offer ae for ἔ : prae-
lum, praeces, quaerella, aegestas and the like, the ae represent-
ing a short and very open e : sometimes it stands for a long
e, as often in plaenus, the liquid before and after making
perhaps the e more open (σκηνή is always scaena): and it is
from this form plaenus that in Italian, contrary to the usual
law of long Latin e, we have piena with open e. With such
pedigree then, and with the genuine Latin ae always repre-
sented in Italian by open e, can we hesitate to pronounce
the ae with this open e sound ? ''

The argument sometimes used, for pronouncing ae like
ai, that in the poets we occasionally find ai in the genitive
singular of the first declension, appears to have little weight
in view of the following explanation :

[Mar. vict. de Orthog. et de Metr. Rat„ 1. iii. 38] Ae syllabam quidam
more Graecorum per ai scribunt, nec illud quidem custodient, quia
omnes fere, qui de orthographia aliquid scriptum reliquerunt, prae-
cipiunt, nomina femina casu nominativo a finita, numero plurali in
ae exire, ut Α eliae: eadem per a et i scripta numerum singularem
ostendere, ut hujus Aeliai: inducti a poetis, qui pictai vestis
scripserunt: et quia Graeci per i potissimum hanc syllabam scri-
bunt propter exilitatem litterae, η autem propter naturalem pro-
ductionem jungere vocali alteri non possunt : iata vero, quae est
