WHY WE USE [T. 19

Priscian tells us that earlier it was, as we know, the cus-
“ tom to write two i’s ε

[Keil. v. 111. p. 467] Antiqui solebant duas ii scribere, et alteram
priori subjungere, alteram praeponere sequenti, ut T roiz'a, Maiz'a,
A z'z'ax.

And Quintilian says :

[Quint. Ι. iv. 11.] Sciat etiam Ciceroni placuisse aiio Asaz'z'amque
geminata i scribere.

This doubling of the sound of i, natural, even unavoid-
able, between vowels, gives us the consonant effect (as
vowel, uniting with the preceding, as consonant, introducing
the following, vowel).

K has the same sound as in English.

The grammarians generally agree that k is a superfluous,
or at least unnecessary, letter, its place being filled by c.
Diomedes says :

[Keil. v. 1.pp. 423, 424] Ex his quibusdam supervacuae videntur
k et q, quod c littera harum locum possit implere.

And again ε

Κ consonans muta supervacua, qua utimur quando a correpta

sequitur, ut Kalendae, caput, calumniae.

Its only use is as an initial and sign of certain words, and
it is followed by short a only.
Victorinus says:

[1. iii. 23.] K autem dicitur monophonos, quia nulli vocali jungi-
tur nisi soli a brevi: et hoc ita ut ab ea pars orationis incipit,
aliter autem non recte scribitur.

Priscian says :

[Keil. v. ΙΙ. p. 36.] K supervacua est, ut supra diximus: quae
quamvis scribetur nullam aliam vim habet quam c.
