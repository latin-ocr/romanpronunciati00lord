THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN.

 

PART Ι.

WHY WE USE IT.

IN general, the greater part of our knowledge of the
pronunciation of Latin comes from the Latin grammarians,
whose authority varies greatly in value3 or through inci—
dental statements and expressions of the classic writers
themselves3 or from monumental inscriptions. Of these
three, the first is inferior to the other two in quality, but
they in turn are comparatively meagre in quantity.

In the first place, we know (a most important pieee of
knowledge) that, as a rule, Latin was pronounced as written.
This is evident from the fact, among others, that the same
exceptions recur, and are mentioned over and over again,
in the grammarians, and that so much is made of eompara-
tively, 'and confessedly, insignificant points. Such, we may
be sure, would not have been the ease had exceptions been
numerous. Then we have the authority of Quintilian—-
than whom is no higher. He speaks of the subtleties of
the grammarians :

[Quint. Ι. iv. 6.] Interiora velut sacri hujus adeuntibus apparebit
multa rerum subtilitas, quae non modo acuere ingenia puerilia sed
exercere altissimam quoque eruditionem ac scientiam possit.

And says :

[ld. ib. iv. 7.] An cujuslibet auris est exigere litterarum sonos?
