10 THE ROMAN PRONUNCJATJON OF LATJN.

B before s or t is sharpened to p: thus urbs is pro-
nounced urps,· obtinuit, optinuit. Some words, indeed, are
written either way, as obses, or opses‚· obsonium, or opsonium,-
obtingo, or optiugo,· and Quintilian says it is a question
whether the change should be indicated in writing or not:

[Quint. Ι. vii. 7.] Quaeri solet, in scribendo praepositiones, sonum
quem junctae efficiunt an quem separatae, observare conveniat : ut
cum dico obtinuit, secundam enim b litteram ratio poscit, aures
magis audiunt p.

This change, however, is both so slight and so natural
that attention need scarcely be called to it. Indeed if quan-
tity is properly observed, one can hardly go wrong. If, for
instance, you attempt, in saying obtinuit, to give its normal
sound to b, you can scarcely avoid making a false quantity
(the first syllable too long), while if. you observe the quan-
tity (first syllable short) your b will change itself to p·

. C appears to have but one sound, the hard, as in sceptic:

[Mar. Vict. Keil, v. VI. p. 32.] C etiam et . . . G sono proximae,
oris molimine nisuque dissentiunt. Nam c reducta introrsum
lingua hinc atque hinc molares urgens haerentem intra os sonum
vocis excludit: g vim prioris pari linguae habitu palato suggerens
lenius reddit.

Not only do we find no hint in the grammarians of any
sound akin to the soft c in English, as in sceptro, but they
all speak of c and k and q as identical, or substantially so,
in sound 3 and Quintilian expressly states that the sound of
c is always the same. Speaking of k as superfluous, he
says:

[Quint. Ι. vii. 10.] Nam k quidem in nullis verbis utendum puto,
nisi quae significat, etiam ut sola ponatur. Hoc eo non omisi,

quod quidam eam quotiens a sequatur necessariam credunt, cum
sit c littera, quae ad omnes vocales vim suam perferat.
