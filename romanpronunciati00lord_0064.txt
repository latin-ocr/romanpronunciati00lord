56 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATJN.

No one will disagree with Professor Ellis when he “as-
sumes,'' in his Quantitative Pronunciation of Latin, “that
the Augustan Romans had no force accent, that is, that they
did not, as we do, distinguish one syllable in every word
zbzvariably by pronouncing it with greater force, that is, with
greater loudness, than the others, but that the force varied
according to the feeling of the moment, or the beat of the
timekeeper in singing‚ and was used for purposes of ex-
pression3 just as with us, musical pitch is free, that is, just
as we may pronounce the same word with different musical
pitches for its different syllables, and in fact are obliged to
vary the musical pitch in interrogations and replies. The
fixity of musical pitch and freedom of degrees of force in
Latin, and the freedom of musical pitch and fixity of degrees
of force in English sharply distinguish the two pronuncia-
tions even irrespective of quantity.⁷'

But this pitch accent, while alien to us, is not impossible
of acquisition, and it is essential to any adequate rendering
of any Latin writer, whether of prose or verse. Nor will
the attainment be a work of indefinite time if one pursues
with constancy some such course as the following, recom-
mended by Professor Ellis :

“The place of raised pitch,⁷' he says, “must be strictly
observed, and for this purpose the verses had better be first
read in a kind of sing—song, the high pitched syllables being
all of one pitch and the low pitched syllables being all of
one pitch also, but about a musical ‘fifth' lower than the
other, as if the latter were sung to the lowest note of the
fourth string of a violin, and the former were sung to the
lowest note of its third string.''

In the foregoing pages an effort has been made to bring
together compactly and to set forth concisely the nature of
