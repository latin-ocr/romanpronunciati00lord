32 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATJN.

It is significant here that Cicero speaks of the change
from du to b as a contraction. He says ε

[Cic. Or. LXV.] Quid vero licentius quam quod hominum etiarn
nomina contrahebant, quo essent aptiora? Nam ut duellum,
bellum; et duis, bz's; sic Duellium eum qui Poenos classe devi-

cit Bellium nominaverunt, cum superiores appellati essent semper
Duelliz'.

One cannot but feel in reading the numerous passages in
the grammarians that treat of the sound of u consonant,
that if its sound had been no other than the natural sound
of u with consonantal force, they never would have spent
so much time and labor in explaining and elucidating it.
Why did they not turn it off with the simple explanation
which they give to the consonantal i—that of double i?
What more natural than to speak of consonant u as “double
u’' (as we English do W). But on the contrary they ex-
pressly declare it to have a sound distinct and peculiar.
Quintilian says that even if the form of the Aeolic dzgamma
is rejected by the Romans, yet its force pursues them ε

[Quint. X11.x.29.] Aeolicae quoque litterae qua servum cer-
vumque dicimus, etiamsi forma a nobis repudiata est, vis tamen
nos ipsa persequitur.

He gives it as his opinion that it would have been well
to have adopted the vau, and says that neither by the old
way of writing (by uo), nor by the modern way (by uu), is
at all produced the sound which we perceive:

[Quint. Ι. vii. 26.] N unc u gemina scribuntur (servus et cervus)
ea ratione quarn reddidi: neutro sane modo vox quam sentimus
efficitur. N ec inutiliter Claudius Aeolicam illam ad hos usus lit-
teram adjecerat.
