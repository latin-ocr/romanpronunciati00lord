12 THE ROMAN PRONUNCJATJON OF LATJN.

the writer saw no difference between c and k, so to the
writer of the former k was the same as c before e.''

Again he says :

“And finally, what is to me most convincing of all, I do
not well understand how in a people of grammarians‚ when
for seven hundred years, from Ennius to Priscian, the most
distinguished writers were also the most minute philologers,
not one, so far as we know, should have hinted at any dif-
ference, if such existed.''

As to the peculiar effect of c final in certain particles
to “lengthen'' the vowel before it, this c is doubtless the
remnant of the intensive enclitic ce, and the so-called
‘length' is not in the vowel, but in the more forcible
utterance of the c. It is true that Priscian says:

[Keil. v. ΙΙ. p. 34.] Notandum, quod ante hanc solam mutam
finalem inveniuntur longae vocales, ut lzo‘c, Ιῑᾶε, sic, lzz’c adverbium.

And Probus speaks of c as often prolonging the vowel
before it. But Victorinus, more philosophically, attributes
the length to the “double '² sound of the consonant:

[Mar. Vict. Ι. ν. 46.] Consideranda ergo est in his duntaxat pro-
nominibus natura c litterae, quae crassum quodammodo et quasi
geminum sonum reddat, lzz‘c et lzoc.

And he adds that you do not get that more emphatic
sound in, for instance, the conjunction'nec.

Si autem nec conjunctionem aspiciamus, licet eadem littera
finitam, diversum tamen sonabit.

And again :

Ut dixi, in pronominibus c littera sonum efficit crassiorem.

Pompeius, commenting upon certain vices of speech, says

that some persons bring out the final c in certain words too
heavily, pronouncing sic ludit as sic clzcdit,· while others, on
