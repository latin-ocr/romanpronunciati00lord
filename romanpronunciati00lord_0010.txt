2 THE ROMAN PRONUNCJATJON OF LATJN.

But after citing some of those idiosyncrasies which appear
on the pages of all the grammarians, he finally sums up the
matter in the following significant words:

[Id. ib. vii. 30, 31.] Indicium autem suum grammaticus interponat
his omnibus 3 nam hoc valere plurimum debet. Ego (note the ego)
nisi quod consuetudo obtinuerit sic scribendum quidque judico,
quomodo sonat. Hic enim est usus litterarum, ut custodiant voces
et velut depositum reddant legentibus, itaque id exprimere debent
quod dicturi sumus.

This is still a characteristic of the Italian language, so
that one may by books, getting the rules from the gram—
marians, learn to pronounce the language with a good
degree of correctness.

On this point Professor Munro says:

“We see in the first volume of the Corpus Inscr. Latin. a
map, as it were, of the language spread open before us, and
feel sure that change of spelling meant systematical change
of pronunciation: coiret, eoem, eumz,- aliquos, aequm, aecus ,-
qzceicumque, quicumque, etc.> etc.⁷'

And again:

‘⁴ We know exactly how Cicero or Quintilian did or could
spell 3 we know the syllable on which they placed the accent
of almost every word; and in almost every case we already
follow them in this. Ι have the conviction that in their
best days philological people took vast pains to make the
writing exactly reproduce the sounding; and that if Quin-
tilian or Tacitus spelt a word differently from Cicero or
Livy, he also spoke it so far differently.''

Three chief factors are essential to the Latin language,
and each of these must be known with some good degree of
certainty, if we would lay claim to an understanding of
Roman pronunciation.
